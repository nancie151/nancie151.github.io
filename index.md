# About Me

ðŸŽ“ Recent graduate from the University of Colorado, Boulder with a MSc in Data Science

I am a highly motivated data enthusiast with a strong foundation in data analysis and programming. My journey at the University of Colorado Boulder has equipped me with a diverse skill set that revolves around ultilizing the power of data to drive informed decision-making. I have cultivated a diverse portfolio and worked on projects that incorporated machine learning and deep learning concepts to solve problems.

ðŸ”‘ I am experienced in Python (NumPy, Pandas, Keras, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Altair, Seaborn), R, mySQL, and PowerBI. I am also working toward AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certificate.

# My Background
I started college majoring in Biochemistry with the intention of pursuing a career in medicine. However, during my final year of college, I had the opportunity to join a research lab that utilized computational screening techniques to investigate infectious diseases. The concept of ultilizing data and technology to tackle real-life challenges fascinated me. It was during this time that my interest in exploring the potential applications of Machine Learning and Data Science beyond the realm of medicine was ignited. I came to realize how incredibly valuable these skills could be used in a wide range of industries.

After completing my undergraduate degree, I made a deliberate decision to further my education by pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science. My belief is firmly rooted in the idea that leveraging data has the potential to bring about meaningful and positive changes in the world.

I am driven by the idea that by applying data-driven insights, we can address complex problems and make a substantial impact on society. I am committed to using my knowledge and skills to actively contribute to projects that have the power to create a better future.
